# Week01

numerical and analytical are close → approximation → we need to consider the error bar

through different way;however, we want the same answer.

we have to consider how meaningful about analytical sol. → errors

- round off error
    - finite digits
- truncation error
    - decide the stopping point

certain digits + estimated digit(half of the smallest scale)

accuracy v.s. precision

error definition → percent relative error

$0.5 * 10 ^ {(2 - n)}$ (n is the runTimes)

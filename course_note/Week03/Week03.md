### Chapter Four

Step size → large: error less; small error more and accumulate.   

$partial(f(x)) / partial(h) = 0$ → to get the minimal error.

There are three inseting ways to find the error; however, this class we intro the middle way. And we need calculus to find the error.

We have to consider round-off error and truncation error to let the numerical error minimize.

blunders → what stupid people did, formulation errors → there are still some phenomanon that we haven’t certained, data uncertainty

How will you improve the accuracy of the divergence?

### Chapter Five

if we meet the complex polynomial → through graphic method to find the point interect with x-axis.

- Bisection:
    - divided into 2, we can count the truth steps of getting the value what we want.
    - True error never exceeds delta(x) / 2
    - more times
- False position:
    - linear interpolation
    - less times

### Chapter Six

- Simple fixed-point iteration:
    - rewrite the funciton → left-side = right-side
